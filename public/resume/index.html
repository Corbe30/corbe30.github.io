Maintained and enhanced spreadsheet library FortuneSheet, resulting in 24% increase in weekly downloads. Managed code reviews, resolved issues, and upheld coding standards and license compliance.
Reduce latency from 4.5s to 0.8s on edit operations by optimizations in formula parser. Resulted 20% bump in fps in large sheets optimizations in cell-text handling.

Snaptrude
Algorithms Engineer [08/2023 - 08/2024]

Utilized knowledge of graphics programming and WebGL to solve mathematical and algorithmic problems for 20,000 users.
Developed Archicad Parser: Worked in the development of a C&#43;&#43; plugin used to export Snaptrude’s models into Archicad. Parsed using Node.js server. Used Amazon Cloudfront (CDN) and S3 for storing geometry data. Fixed major bugs, added support for furniture export.
Delete storey operation: Solo developer in a feature to delete Snaptrude storeys. Developed frontend in Typescript, React and Redux; and backend APIs in Node.js server. Used linked list for managing storeys and Command design pattern to implement undo-redo operations on queue data structure. Supported with unit tests.
Revamped Snaptrude Manager: Improved Snaptrude’s desktop application &#43; plugin used for interoperability with Autodesk Revit. Developed user interface in React and Redux, and supporting RESTful APIs in Django backend. Migrated plugin code from Python to C#.
Optimizations: Implemented series of optimizations in mongoDB for slow server response by implementing bulkWrite. Reduced Revit export JSON file size by 50% and made API enhancements, saving 2 minutes of AWS S3 bucket export time for large projects.

Testbook
Android Developer [02/2023 - 08/2023]

Maintained and developed features in Kotlin for Testbook app for 5 million active users in the Android team.
Drove 14.7% revenue growth through Testbook Pass Pro by developing UI elements in Compose and XML, integrating analytics events to WebEngage and Firebase, deep links, and improving UX.
Increased book sales by 272% within a month by developing Smartbooks e‑commerce module ‑ implemented Jetpack Compose UI components, implementing MVVM architecture for the Book Details page, integration and consuming RESTful API in JSON and introducing pin code validation feature.
Orchestrated an A/B testing on all users by utilizing Firebase Engage and triggering 9 events across 144 locations within the app, revealing a significant 12% difference in purchase clicks and strengthening product decisions.
Troubleshooted bugs and crashes in Juspay payment gateway integration, resulting in a substantial improvement in the overall user experience and successful transactions.

Projects


FortuneExcel - an .xlsx import/export plugin for FortuneSheet with over 1.7k downloads on npm. Built on Typescript and React.
Multiplayer Snake Game - Developed and deployed a 2‐player Snake game in Javasript. Supports customizable snake colors, personal room creation, live score tracking, and rematch functionality.

Achievements


Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure (NCIIPC) - Acknowledged by National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, India (NCIIPC) for identifying and reporting  a directory traversal attack on MPEDA’s website, which exposed Aadhaar card information of 100&#43; Indian citizens.
